not on stack overflow.
the current ip addr is 192.168.1.102.
web page is loaded from the url with above ip.
index page is including js files.
each js file making http req to php file hosted on server with the above ip.
the old ip was 192.168.1.102.
browser cache had those js files in it. so changes made in js files were not effecting the outcome and were
placing http requests to php file on server with old ip.
to tacke this I cleared browser cache but outcome was same.
then I changed the name of js files and in html included the js files with changed names.
now these new renamed js files were not in cache and were making http req to php file on server with correct/new ip.
the problem was that js files were loaded from cache and not from server. hence changes made in js files on server were not being reflected.
